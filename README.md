# P6_textile_corrective_autommaton

this project is dedicated to making a framework for the P6 project of Robotics, 
  the solution involves integration of 
    -a gardasoft compatible backlight
    -a ur10 equpped with a needle gripper
    -an alied vision camera
  the goal of the solution is to create a robotic cell workflow for a corrective preparation cell in the factory industry
    the solution is supposed to correct the placement of two textiles in relation to eachother such that they are prepared to be sent through a sewing machine

  it consists of 4 main parts
    the image capture node

    the textile edge detection node

    the hand eye calibration node

    the movement execution node

a set of diagrams explaining the code can be found on the folowing link
